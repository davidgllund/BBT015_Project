# About

This is a notebook that in chronological order contains descriptions of the results that were obtained from performed experiments. In addition it also contains relevant reflections about every experiment, such as ideas about why the expected result was not yielded by the analysis.

Every entry should include information about when the experient was performed and by whom, as well as where the relevant figure/table/etc can be found (file name and sub-directory).
