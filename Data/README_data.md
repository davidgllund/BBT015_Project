# Data

## Sample data

The sample data was obtained from ArrayExpress, with the association number E-GEOD-57868,  and is a supplement to the paper which the project is based on. The data consists of RNA-seq data from six samples of the bacteria *M. tuberculosis*, which were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000. All samples were from the CDC1551 strain of *M.tuberculosis*, samples 1-3 are controls that have not been mutated, samples 4-6 have been mutated by knocking out the *Rv1026 (ppx2)* gene. Links to the sample data are provided below.

## Reference genome

The reference genome for the CDC1551 strain of *M. tuberculosis* was obtained from Ensembl, as was described in the relevant paper. The link to the reference genome is provide below.
